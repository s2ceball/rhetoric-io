**Description**

rhetoric.io is a boutique data repository for writing studies and related fields. The mission of this project is to provide an institutionally independent, centralized location for writing researchers to make their own datasets public. By publicizing our datasets, other researchers as well as the non-academic public can find and further writing research through analysis, remix, visualizations, and other uses of boutique data. 

**Work Plan**

In the first phase of rhetoric.io, the repository will be distributed, pointing outward to ownersâ€™ data sets. To do that, the advisory team is working on the following milestones:

- publishing an app to collect brief info on dataset types and possible collaborators

- establish specs for lightweight data serialization/distribution in JSON

- publish a spec to teach people how to share and consume data in JSON

- create a site that publishes pointers to data sets

In the second phase, the repository will serve as a sustainable data storage venue suitable for federal granting agencies so that writing researchers can create redundant data sets for long-term  preservation. 

**Dataset Examples**
During phase one of rhetoric.io, the advisory committee is drawing on datasets they have access to (and potentially others) to fine-tune the JSON mark-up that will be distributed as the tagging guideline for the repository. Some of these datasets include:

- Masters Degree in Rhetoric consortium survey data

- FSU Postcard Archive

- database of female pedagogues

- CCC archive

- Kairos metadata 


**Additional possible datasets**

- Rhetoric and Composition Job Map (KML file) 

- Online Journals in Rhetoric and Composition data project

- Writing Studies Tree archive 

- Digital Archive of Literacy Narratives

- permissable student texts (including multimodal)

- various wikis, including DRC wiki and RikiWiki

- other raw qualitative and quantitative data including surveys, interviews, etc.
